-- Create admin user in profiles table (the auth user will be created manually)
-- We'll insert a profile for a specific admin user ID that we'll provide to the user

-- Insert admin profile (replace with actual user ID after creating auth user)
-- This is a placeholder - we'll need to create the auth user first and then update this
-- INSERT INTO public.profiles (user_id, full_name, role) 
-- VALUES ('admin-user-id-here', 'Admin User', 'admin');
